# Yolo8-Implementation-on-custom-datasets

YOLOv8 offers two main approaches to implement object detection on your custom dataset:

1. YOLOv8 Command Line Interface (CLI):

This method provides a user-friendly way to train and use YOLOv8 without writing code. Here's a breakdown:

Data Preparation:

Organize your images and annotations in specific formats. Images can be in standard formats (JPEG, PNG) and annotations typically use a text file format (e.g., VOC, YOLO). Each line describes an object's bounding box (coordinates) and class label in the image.
Tools like VGG Image Annotator (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) can help with annotation.
Configuration File:

A YAML file defines training parameters like batch size, number of epochs (training iterations), learning rate, and paths to your images and annotations.
The YOLOv8 repository provides examples for reference.
Training:

Run a specific command in your terminal using the yolov8 executable and specifying the configuration file.
The model trains on your data, and you can monitor its progress and performance metrics.
2. YOLOv8 Python SDK:

For more control and customization, you can leverage the YOLOv8 Python SDK. This involves writing Python code to interact with the model and data:

Data Loading:

You'll write code to load your images and annotations using libraries like OpenCV or custom functions.
Model Training:

The SDK provides classes and functions for defining the model architecture, optimizer, and training loop.
You can customize the training process and experiment with hyperparameters.
Fine-tuning Pre-trained Weights:

Both methods allow you to fine-tune pre-trained YOLOv8 weights for your specific objects. This leverages the model's existing knowledge and accelerates training on your custom data.
